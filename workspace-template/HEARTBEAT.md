# HEARTBEAT.md – Daily/Periodic Duties (keep short)

Run every 60–120 min during waking hours. Batch intelligently.

1. Self-evolution round (once per day):
   - Review yesterday’s memory/ logs.
   - Identify repeated actions → propose automation.
   - Estimate token ROI.
   - Write/test new skill or improve existing.
   - Commit to repo + open PR for review.

2. Knowledge maintenance:
   - Distill new facts into MEMORY.md.
   - Update JSON index / Obsidian.
   - Run backup-knowledge.sh.

3. Public interfaces check (as directed):
   - Update news site if new content.
   - Monitor X/website for tasks.

4. Inbox & opportunity scan:
   - Email/Telegram triage.
   - Surface any new user tasks.

5. Token optimization scan:
   - Any action repeated 3+ times this week? Flag for automation.

If nothing requires action → reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
If I updated HEARTBEAT.md, mention it in the next main chat.
